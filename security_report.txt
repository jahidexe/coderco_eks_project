EKS CLUSTER SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT
====================================

1. SECURITY GROUP CONFIGURATION
------------------------------
Risk Level: HIGH

Findings:
- Overly permissive egress rules allowing all traffic to 0.0.0.0/0
- Unrestricted DNS access (port 53 UDP)
- Unrestricted HTTPS access (port 443 TCP)

Why Not Allowed:
- Violates principle of least privilege
- Increases attack surface
- Allows potential data exfiltration
- Non-compliant with security standards (CIS, NIST)

Best Practices:
- Restrict egress to specific CIDR ranges
- Use security group references instead of CIDR blocks
- Implement specific port requirements
- Create separate security groups for different components
- Use network ACLs for additional layer of security

2. API ACCESS CONFIGURATION
--------------------------
Risk Level: CRITICAL

Findings:
- Public API endpoint enabled
- Unrestricted public access CIDRs (0.0.0.0/0)
- Both private and public access enabled

Why Not Allowed:
- Exposes cluster control plane to internet
- Increases risk of unauthorized access
- Violates zero-trust principles
- Non-compliant with enterprise security policies

Best Practices:
- Disable public API endpoint
- Enable private endpoint only
- Implement VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Use bastion hosts for management access
- Implement VPN or Direct Connect for secure access

3. IAM CONFIGURATION
-------------------
Risk Level: HIGH

Findings:
- Broad IAM policies attached to cluster role
- Node group roles with excessive permissions
- Missing IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)

Why Not Allowed:
- Violates principle of least privilege
- Increases risk of privilege escalation
- Non-compliant with IAM best practices
- Potential for unauthorized resource access

Best Practices:
- Create custom IAM policies with minimal permissions
- Implement IRSA for service accounts
- Use OIDC for service account authentication
- Regular IAM permission audits
- Implement IAM access analyzer

4. NETWORK CONFIGURATION
-----------------------
Risk Level: MEDIUM

Findings:
- Large VPC CIDR (10.0.0.0/16)
- Public subnets with auto-assigned public IPs
- Unrestricted NAT Gateway access

Why Not Allowed:
- Increases attack surface
- Makes network segmentation difficult
- Non-compliant with network security standards
- Potential for IP address exhaustion

Best Practices:
- Use smaller CIDR blocks
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Disable auto-assign public IPs
- Use private subnets for worker nodes
- Implement proper NAT Gateway rules

5. LOGGING CONFIGURATION
-----------------------
Risk Level: MEDIUM

Findings:
- Short log retention period (7 days)
- Missing CloudWatch alarms
- Incomplete control plane logging

Why Not Allowed:
- Insufficient for security investigations
- Non-compliant with audit requirements
- Difficult to track security incidents
- Violates compliance requirements

Best Practices:
- Increase log retention to minimum 90 days
- Enable all control plane logs
- Implement CloudWatch alarms
- Regular log analysis
- Centralized logging solution

6. ENCRYPTION CONFIGURATION
--------------------------
Risk Level: MEDIUM

Findings:
- Missing EBS volume encryption
- No explicit encryption for other resources
- KMS key rotation not configured

Why Not Allowed:
- Risk of data exposure
- Non-compliant with encryption standards
- Potential for data breaches
- Violates data protection requirements

Best Practices:
- Enable encryption at rest for all resources
- Implement KMS key rotation
- Use customer-managed keys
- Enable EBS volume encryption
- Implement encryption in transit

7. NODE GROUP SECURITY
---------------------
Risk Level: HIGH

Findings:
- Broad node group IAM permissions
- Missing security hardening
- IMDSv1 enabled

Why Not Allowed:
- Increases attack surface
- Risk of node compromise
- Non-compliant with security standards
- Potential for privilege escalation

Best Practices:
- Implement node security policies
- Use custom AMIs with security hardening
- Enable IMDSv2
- Regular node updates
- Implement node auto-repair

8. TAGGING STRATEGY
------------------
Risk Level: LOW

Findings:
- Inconsistent tagging
- Missing security classification
- Incomplete cost allocation tags

Why Not Allowed:
- Difficult resource management
- Non-compliant with tagging standards
- Inefficient cost tracking
- Security classification issues

Best Practices:
- Implement consistent tagging strategy
- Add security classification tags
- Use cost allocation tags
- Regular tag audits
- Automated tagging enforcement

9. NETWORK POLICY
----------------
Risk Level: MEDIUM

Findings:
- Missing default deny policy
- Incomplete namespace policies
- Network policy enforcement not configured

Why Not Allowed:
- Increases lateral movement risk
- Non-compliant with network security
- Potential for unauthorized access
- Violates zero-trust principles

Best Practices:
- Implement default deny policy
- Create namespace-specific policies
- Enable network policy enforcement
- Regular policy audits
- Implement network segmentation

10. POD SECURITY
---------------
Risk Level: HIGH

Findings:
- Using baseline security standards
- Missing security context
- Incomplete pod security policies

Why Not Allowed:
- Insufficient security controls
- Non-compliant with security standards
- Risk of container escape
- Potential for privilege escalation

Best Practices:
- Upgrade to restricted security standards
- Implement pod security admission controller
- Use security context constraints
- Regular security audits
- Implement runtime security
